# README

Since solving tech tests will probably never be as relevant as it is for other people from the cohort, I will take another approach to tech test week.

I will:
- use the challenges to practice setting up a project as project manager, i.e. being very clear about user stories and workflow
- use the challenges to rapidly prototype versions of a program that could be used by an untechnical user for first validation
- use Ruby for the first challenge since it's super fast for creating an interface for a user
- put it on the web using Heroku to be able to send it to potential test users
- time limit I set myself: 2 hours

## User stories

```
As a user
So that I can use TechTestBank,
I want to be able to sign up and create an account

As a user
So that I feel that my data is secure
I want sign-in required to interact with my account and want to be able to sign out afterwards

As a user
So that I can see how much money is in my bank account,
I want to be able to see my balance when logged in

As a user
So that I can use my bank account,
I want to be able to make deposits to my account

As a user
So that I can use my bank account,
I want to be able to make withdrawals from my account

As a user
So that I can see what's going on with my account,
I want to be able to print a account statement which shows all transactions

```

Update1:
- after 4 hours of coding I build the app satisfying all user stories
- however not yet live on Heroku
- For user testing, I should also add some basic styling to improve uer experience

Update2:
Live on Heroku, check it out:
